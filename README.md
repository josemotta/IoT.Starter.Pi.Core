### IoT Starter Raspberry Pi Core

At this project targeted to Raspberry Pi with Linux, the API First Design strategy is used to develop an ASP.NET Core Web Server automatically generated by Swagger Hub. The availability of Visual Studio running at a speedy x64 cpus with Windows 10 are the key advantages of this starter kit. Previous studies were done before this project, please see links below.

## IoT API for Raspberry Pi

Starting from a Swagger API definition, an ASP.NET Core Web API is developed using SwaggerHub. The code is automatically generated and pushed to github. Then it is loaded by a Windows x64 machine and upgraded to ASP.NET Core 2.0, using Visual Studio 2017.

A multi-stage docker image build is accomplished at the speedy Windows x64 machine, generating code for the linux-arm. The same VS solution include separated projects for the web server and web UI. Both docker images are pushed to the cloud and then pulled back into a Raspberry Pi with Raspbian 9.1 stretch installed.

Following is the expected workflow for this project, that will cycle activities for modeling, programming and development, deployment and testing. The main objectives are summarized below.

### Modeling:
 
- API is designed at SwaggerHub
- Web service stub is automatically generated by SwaggerHub
- SwaggerHub connects directly with GitHub repository
- SwaggerHub is configured to push code to 'swag' branch at Github

### Development at x64 with Windows 10:

- Install Docker

	**Web Service**

- Pull Swaggerhub generated code from github
- Upgrade to .NET Core 2 framework and Docker support
- Merge code from swag branch to master
- Create multi-stage docker build for web service    
- Compiles at x64 machine for linux-arm framework  
- Push Docker image to cloud: home-web  

	**Web UI**

- Generate another project based on default razor pages app
- Add multi-stage docker build for web ui  
- Push Docker image to cloud: home-ui   

### Deployment at Raspberry Pi with Linux (hostname "rpi")

- Raspbian GNU/Linux 9.1 (stretch) 
- Install Docker  
- Run both Docker images for home-web and home-ui

### Testing
 
- Go back to x64 machine
- Access home-web and home-ui via any browser  

## Running both images at Raspberry Pi

A Raspberry Pi with Raspbian 9.1 stretch is connected in the same LAN of x64 machine. Docker is installed and commands shown below activate the home-ui and home-web images. They start to listen on ports 80 and 5010 respectively.

The commands start clearing all docker containers and images:

Then all projects are started, downloading images from DockerHub to Raspberry Pi. You can notice the home-ui project share four images with home-web project and they don't need to be downloaded again.

Checking at the browser, we see both home-web and home-ui projects running at Raspberry Pi with Linux.

## Upgrading the API

Changes to API are done editing the API master file at Swaggerhub. In order to smoothly update the project, following configuration should be done, selecting the proper repo and a new branch "swag" to store the changes.

![](https://i.imgur.com/tSo7Cui.png)

Please note that it is necessary to allow full control over some folders, including models, controllers and wwwroot, as shown below. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/OrjIqma.png)

The generated files may include some garbage that should be cleaned properly, including some .json and .sln files from previous Visual Studio versions.

From time to time, some breaking changes may happen at Swaggerhub generated code. In these cases, conversion to ASP.Net Core 2.0 maybe done automatically by Visual Studio, I used Community 2017 Preview2. Change the Output Folder at Swaggerhub Integration to "home2", and allow VS to adjust automatically the solution files, libraries, etc. Then bring the changes to "home" in another safe step.

Use the Visual Studio to setup Docker, apply menu "Add Docker support" for the solution. Then docker-compose and dockerfile maybe adjusted, properly pulling the strings for a smooth operation at Windows x64 machine.

## Conclusion

This starter kit may improve or establish connections to the huge amount of work already done at Linux platform. Projects like LIRC, the Linux Infrared Remote Control for Raspberry Pi, will be explored soon.

For now, have fun with this project!
